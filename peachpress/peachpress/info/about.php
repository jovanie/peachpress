<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>
<!--Paragraph-->
Peach Press was founded by us, Raizele Arceo and Jovanie De La Cruz, as a way for artists to create unique ready-to-sell products from their art. Each of our artists have complete control on how they make their art (from choosing their media, their materials, to which products would be available in their name), we are here to assist them in their marketing. 
All our products are made in our studio based in Chicago and are only produced when you order them, on-demand, in order to avoid waste and keep our business sustainable. We are affiliated with Atlantis Industriesâ„¢ to provide you with high-quality tops made with 100% fine jersey cotton combed for comfort.
