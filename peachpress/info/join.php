<h4>YOU CONTROL THE RIGHTS OF YOUR WORK</h4>
<p>What's yours, is yours! When you post your artwork on Peach Press, you continue to control the rights to it. We've made it easy for you to be able to make one Post right here on Peach Press, and if selected by our Retail Partners, have it made available through their online stores without forfeiting your rights to your work, nice.</p>
<h4>YOU DETERMINE THE PRICE OF YOUR WORK</h4>
<p>Set your retail price and your profit for each art print type and size, if you don't add profit then all sizes will be made available at the base price. Based on the quality of your digital file, we will only allow you to post at sizes that will reproduce as high-quality prints, some sizes may not be available.</p>
<h4>YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR ART ON</h4>
<p>You will also be able to add T-shirts, Laptop Skins and more to accompany your Print after you publish it (Stretched Canvas is added for you). Instead of setting your pricing and profits, you will be paid the published profits on the sale of each of these products.</p>
<h4>YOU CAN TRACK YOUR EARNINGS</h4>
<p>When one of your prints or other products is purchased, it gets produced, packed and shipped while you get paid. Track your earnings in your Account (you get paid every 1st of the month via Paypal - with a 30 day per purchase grace period from date of sale). Ex: if you sell something on Jan 15th, it is clear on Feb 15th and then you get paid on March 1st.</p>
